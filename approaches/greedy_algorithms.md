Types of algorithm
* Divide and conquer = independent (not overlapping) subproblems combined for solution
* Greedy algorithms = independent (not overlapping) subproblems that do not all have to be solved
* Dynamic programming = interdependent (overlapping) subproblems combined for solution

Types of Greedy Algorithms
* Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm
