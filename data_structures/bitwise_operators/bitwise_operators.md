**Bitwise operators**

Definition = operators that support bitwise calculations

* `&` = AND operator copies a bit if it exists in both operands
* `|` = OR operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand
* `^` = XOR operator copies the bit if it is in one set but not both
* `<<` = Left shift operator moves in `A << 2` A's bits left by 2 
* `>>` = Right shift operator moves in `A >> 2` A's bits right by 2
