There are types of problems:
1. permutations n!
2. combinations n C k
3. subsets 2^n

Permutations 
* 

Combinations
* Generate = loop over candidates
* Order doesn't matter = how remove duplicates? 
    1. Set 
    2. Only add if larger number e.g. `combination_sum.scala`
* Solutions
    1. Accumulate through return statement, empty list as base case `combination_sum.scala`

Subsets
