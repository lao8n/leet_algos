Insertion sort:
sorted  | unsorted
1 3 5 8 | 4 6 7 9 2
1 3 4 5 8 | 6 7 9 2
The 4 is inserted into the sorted section - but it only needs to compare to the 
sorted elements

Bubble sort: 
unsorted  | biggest
3 1 5 4 2 | 6 7 8 9
1 3 4 2 | 5 6 7 8 9
The 5 is bubble into the biggest section but it only needs to compare the 
unsorted area and some of the biggest
